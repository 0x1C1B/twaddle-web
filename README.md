## Introduction

This is the UI of the Twaddle messenger, a messenger with user management
for mutual communication exchange in real time. This project does not serve
to replace existing messengers from production, but rather to understand
communication processes in the area of messaging.

This is the first party web client of the Twaddle messenger.
